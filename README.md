# 👋 Welcome to Rookie Level Design!

Are you a junior developer looking to learn more about system design? Look no further! We've got everything you need to get started.

## 📚 Getting Started

First things first, head over to our **Low-level Design** section and pick a problem statement that you'd like to explore. You can attempt the problem in any language, even though most solutions are coded in **JS** or **Java**.

Read the problem statement and **Key Concepts** sections properly to understand the problem. 

## 🚀 Ready to Build?

If you're ready to build, you can start coding up your solution keeping the **Key Concepts** in mind. After finishing your code, you can **Clone** the solution repository and compare your code against it. 

The solution repository contains well-structured, heavily commented code that follows best practices. **Even if you were unable to code your own solution, studying the solution repository can teach you a lot.**
